        <p class="par">On Sunday I went to visit my grandparents in Kanchanaburi. I like my grandparents because they always give me a present when I visit them. My grandfather doesn?t work now because he is retired. He is in his late seventies. My grandmother is in her seventies too. We went to Kanchanaburi by car. It took more than two hours to drive there. I was tired when we arrived and a little bored.</p>

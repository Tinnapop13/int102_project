        <p class="par">After I woke up this morning, I made the regrettable decision of waking up. I tried to go back to sleep, but I could not even relax. Today was one of those days where either I get up, or I get up. I then decided to go outside, but because it was raining, I got wet. I went back inside, felt tired enough to go back to bed, but I still had to change out of my wet clothes. Then I got a phone call from you know who. I got so excited that I didnâ€™t care that I was naked, tired, and there was a puddle on the floor. We are going on a date this Friday.And Again it's just a dream</p>

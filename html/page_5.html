        <p class="par">Today I got up at eleven oâ€™clock. I washed my face and took a bath. I had rice, fried egg, clear soup and spicy minced pork. I went to school by motorcycle. I went to my classroom. I went to the playground. I sang the national anthem and I chanted. I went back up to my classroom. I memorized the multiplication table with my friends. I read English and Thai books. Today my favourite Subject was English because we went to the computer room. We wrote our diary. In the evening I did math. </p>
